[data]
	# Only static data defined in `chezmoi.toml.tmpl`
	# are listed here.
	#
	# Dynamic data are generated by _dynamic/configurator.py, dumped into _dynamic/dyn_config.json
	# and are rendered for your convenience in dynamic_data.txt
	# 
	# You can switch to another dynamic configuration by changing the value
	# in your .chezmoidata in you home directory and running `chezmoi apply`.
	# When before applying, chezmoi will generate a new dyn_config.json and
	# recalculate any .tmpl files.
	# 
	# The .tmpl files are reading the dynamic data directly from dyn_config.json
	# by having `$dyn := include "_dynamic/dyn_config.json | mustFromJson -` in the 
	# template double braces.
