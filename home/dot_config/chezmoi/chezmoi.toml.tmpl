[data]
	# Only static data defined in `chezmoi.toml.tmpl`
	# are listed here.
	#
	# Dynamic data are generated by _dynamic/configurator.py, dumped into _dynamic/dyn_config.json
	# and are rendered for your convenience in dynamic_data.txt
	# 
	# You can switch to another dynamic configuration by changing the value
	# in your .chezmoidata in your home directory and running `chezmoi apply`.
	# Before applying, chezmoi will generate a new dyn_config.json and
	# recalculate any .tmpl files.
	# 
	# To read access of the dynamically configured values in a .tmpl file,
	# use `$dyn := include "_dynamic/dyn_config.json | mustFromJson -`
	# somewhere at the start of the file.
